### Hi there 👋 ###

I'm an HTML/CSS/JS detractor and an avid supporter of XHTML and Wasm for use in web development.

When I'm not involved in web development, I can be found working with hardware and circuitry, or optimizing (low-level) code.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [SIMD.ts](https://github.com/CrimsonCodes0/SIMD.ts), and porting [NibbleAndAHalf](https://github.com/CrimsonCodes0/NibbleAndAHalf) to C++20.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Rust programming language, and Google's Firebase API for C++.
